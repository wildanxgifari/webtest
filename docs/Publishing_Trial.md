With this plugin, alhamdulillah we had successfully pushed Obsidian notes (.md) to a GitHub repo.

but this .md format needs a publisher as well

currently, FKMIT GitHub pages will create the pages from .html

we need a way to publish .md based notes in GitHub

Alhamdulillah, succesfully made the .md website

Next, connect catatan ke github fkmit

side menu of the notesd (and maybe searching function)

set wildan as admin
